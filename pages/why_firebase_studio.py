## Why Firebase Studio Stands Out

Firebase Studio, launched in April 2025, is redefining app development. Here’s why it’s a game-changer:

- **Free and Accessible**: Offers three free workspaces in preview, with no upfront cost.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro Integration**: Uses the top-ranked AI model (31 points ahead on LMSYS Arena) with a 1-million-token context window for complex tasks.
- **Full-Stack Solution**: Combines Firebase’s backend (Firestore, Authentication, Hosting) with AI-driven frontend development.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: No-code prototyping for novices, robust Code OSS-based IDE for pros.
- **Rapid Progress**: Continuously improving with community feedback, powered by the best coding model.

Firebase Studio is ideal for developers of all levels, from vibe coders to seasoned pros. Start building at [firebase.studio](https://firebase.studio).
